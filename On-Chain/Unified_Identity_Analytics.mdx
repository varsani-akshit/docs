**Turn traffic into wallet-linked intelligence**

Ever wonder if those 5,000 visitors from your last Twitter thread actually did anything? Like, did they just vibe with your landing page… or did they connect a wallet and mint?

Unified Identity Analytics answers that.

**Here’s what you get out of it:**

- **See the full journey**: From someone casually browsing your site → to becoming a Web3 user → to connecting a wallet → and actually _transacting on-chain_. We map that whole funnel out for you. You’ll know exactly where people are falling off — and where you’re winning.
- **Know which channels bring money, not noise**: Traffic from SEO might bring thousands of visitors. But Discord? That’s where the _wallet whales_ are lurking. This module shows you which traffic sources are driving actual on-chain value, not just vanity numbers.
- **Let geography guide your next campaign**: With our map view, you can instantly see which countries are home to your most valuable wallets. Filter by total spend, transaction count, or average value. Perfect for targeting new regions or just realizing, “Wait, we’re _big_ in Korea?”
- **Balance engagement with value**: The scatter chart helps you compare sources based on how long people stick around **and** how much they spend. Some channels bring lurkers, others bring doers. Now you can tell which is which.
- **Get the full breakdown at a glance**: The table view is your go-to for clarity. For each traffic source, you’ll see how many people showed up, how many connected wallets, how many actually transacted, and how much money came out of it.

#### 💡 Pro Tips: Read Between the Charts

**🔁 Funnel Map→ Unique Visitors → Web3 Users → Wallets Connected → Transacted**

- **Watch for funnel friction:** If you have a huge drop-off between Web3 users and wallet connections, your CTA placement or value prop probably needs work. Consider A/B testing that “Connect Wallet” button or educating users earlier on _why_ to connect.
- **High Web3 users but low transactions?** You’re bringing in the right crowd, but something’s missing post-connection. Maybe your onboarding is too long. Maybe gas fees are a deal-breaker. This is where user session replay or in-wallet friction logs can help.

**📊 Top 7 Traffic Sources by On-Chain USD Volume (Bar Chart)**

- **High traffic ≠ high value:** Paid ads might flood your site, but are those users spending? This chart shows where _real money_ is coming from — so you can put your budget behind proven sources.
- **Use UTM tags wisely:** This chart shines with good UTM hygiene. Avoid overlapping names like `discord`, `Discord`, and `discord-invite`. Standardize early so your insights aren’t fragmented.

**🗺️ Geo Map (w/ Dropdown for Avg Txn Value, Total Txns, Total Txn Value)**

- **Use for hyper-targeted growth campaigns:** Found a region with high _average_ transaction value? That might be your premium user base. Consider retargeting or offering region-specific perks.
- **Spot underserved high-intent markets:** If a country has a decent number of transactions but low total value, it may be early-stage. Run educational campaigns or token-gated bounties to deepen engagement.
- **Combine with chain preference:** Pair geo data with wallet chain distribution to discover, say, that _your Indian user base prefers Polygon_. That’s gold for localized messaging.

**📈 Engagement Time vs. LTV (Scatter Plot)**

- **Top-right = your power sources:** These are users who stay longer _and_ spend more. Double down on those channels.
- **Bottom-right = money but no love:** These folks spend fast but don’t stick. Could be whales doing one thing and bouncing. Still valuable — maybe create faster conversion paths for them.
- **Top-left = engaged but not spending:** These users care, but aren’t converting. Time to explore what's stopping them. Maybe they’re hesitant about wallet security, or the offer isn’t clear enough.

**📋 Source Table: Visitors → Web3 Users → Wallets Connected → Transacted → LTV**

- **Look for drop-off deltas: **If one source has low visitor-to-wallet ratios, but high LTV per wallet, that’s a quality over quantity source. Don’t ignore it just because volume is low.
- **Compare wallet connect vs. transaction rate:** If wallet connect is high but very few transact, investigate your post-connection journey. Are people getting stuck? Is the next step unclear?
- **LTV isn’t just about value — it’s about intent:** Some traffic sources naturally bring high-intent users. If you're seeing this pattern, prioritize these sources even in organic content creation.

**📊 Time-to-Chain Conversion Speed (Histogram)**

- Think of this chart as a conversion intent speedometer. You’ll quickly see whether your experience drives fast action or slow, delayed conversions.
- A spike in 0–1h = your CTA hits. They land, they click, they transact.
- Spread across 3–7 days\+ = people may be warming up slowly — retargeting or onboarding emails might help nudge them forward.
- Too many in 7\+ days? Something in the funnel needs work.
